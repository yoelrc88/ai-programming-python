# Getting Started with AI Programming with Python

Welcome! This repository contains coursework from Udacity's **AI Programming with Python** Nanodegree. It includes example notebooks, small projects, and a final image classifier project. Use this guide to navigate the contents and run the main code.

## Repository Structure
- `1-introduction-to-ai-programming/` – a short introduction document for the course.
- `2-intro-to-python/` – notebooks and exercises covering Python fundamentals. Includes a small dog image classifier project (`lesson-6-classifying-images/workspace/`).
- `3-numpy-pandas-matplotlib/` – notebooks showing how to use NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.
- `5-neural-networks/dl-with-pytorch/` – notebooks and helper code for learning PyTorch and building neural networks.
- `6-create-your-own-classifier-project/` – final project with scripts (`train.py`, `predict.py`) for training and using an image classifier.

## Key Scripts
- `train.py` – trains a convolutional neural network using command line arguments to set hyperparameters.
- `predict.py` – loads a trained checkpoint and predicts the top classes for a given image.

## Next Steps
1. Explore the introductory notebooks to refresh your Python and data analysis skills.
2. Run `setup-dataset.bash` in the final project folder to download the flower dataset.
3. Use `train.py` to train a model, then run `predict.py` to classify new images.

Happy learning!
